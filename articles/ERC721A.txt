The goal of ERC721A is to provide a fully compliant implementation of IERC721 with significant gas savings for minting multiple NFTs in a single transaction. This project and implementation will be updated regularly and will continue to stay up to date with best practices.

The Azuki team created ERC721A for its sale on 1/12/22. There was significant demand for 8700 tokens made available to the public, and all were minted within minutes.

The network BASEFEE remained low despite huge demand, resulting in low gas costs for minters, while minimizing network disruption for the wider ecosystem as well.
